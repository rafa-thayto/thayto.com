# Context

I believe every developer has had doubts about the differences between some JavaScript/TypeScript operators. That's why I made this quick and simple post about the differences between the ?, ?? and || operators. Check it out below

## ? - Optional Chaining

`?` -> **Optional Chaining Operator**.
Allows reading the value of a property located internally in a chain of connected objects without having to explicitly validate each reference in the chain.

The `?.` operator works similarly to the `.` chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is [nullish](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Nullish) (`null` or `undefined`), the expression short-circuits and returns with a value of `undefined`. When used with a function call, it returns `undefined` if the executed function does not exist.

This results in shorter and simpler expressions when accessing chained properties when there's a possibility of a reference being non-existent. This can also help when exploring the content of an object when there's no guarantee of certain required properties existing.

**Example**

```js
const user = {
  id: 13,
  name: 'Thayto',
}

console.log(user?.name) // John
console.log(user?.fullName) // undefined, application won't break.
console.log(user.fullName) // TypeError: Cannot read property 'fullName' of undefined, application breaks.
```

## ?? - Nullish Coalescing

`??` -> **Nullish Coalescing Operator**.
Is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is `null` or `undefined`. Otherwise, it returns its left-hand side operand.

**Example**

```js
console.log(13 ?? 'not found') // 13
console.log(0 ?? 'not found') // 0

console.log('Dri' ?? 'not found') // "Dri"
console.log('' ?? 'not found') // ""

console.log(true ?? 'not found') // true
console.log(false ?? 'not found') // false

console.log(undefined ?? 'not found') // "not found"
console.log(null ?? 'not found') // "not found"
```

## || - Logical OR

`||` is the **Logical OR Operator**
The Logical OR expression is evaluated from left to right, it is tested for possible "short-circuit" evaluation using the following rule:

`(some truthy expression) || expr` is short-circuit evaluated to the truthy expression.

Short-circuit means that the `expr` part above is not evaluated, therefore any side effects of doing so do not take effect (for example, if `expr` is a function call, the call never occurs). This happens because the value of the operator is already determined after evaluation of the first operand.

**Example**

```js
console.log(13 || 'not found') // 13
console.log(0 || 'not found') // "not found"

console.log('Dri' || 'not found') // "Dri"
console.log('' || 'not found') // "not found"

console.log(true || 'not found') // true
console.log(false || 'not found') // "not found"

console.log(undefined || 'not found') // "not found"
console.log(null || 'not found') // "not found"
```
