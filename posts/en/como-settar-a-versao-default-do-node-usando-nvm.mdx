For those who don't know yet, `nvm` is an excellent utility for when we want to switch Node versions quickly without having to uninstall the current one and install the desired one.

For a long time I used the command:

```bash
nvm use <DESIRED_VERSION>
```

To switch the Node version to a newer one, until a few days ago I discovered how to change the nvm default version in a very simple way.

Just use the following command changing the `<DESIRED_VERSION>` part to the version you want to keep as default, for example `16.5.0`:

```bash
nvm alias default <DESIRED_VERSION>
```

And that's it, now you'll always be using this nvm version at any time or in any terminal you open 😁.
